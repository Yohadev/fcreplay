Can you add support for Final Match Tennis (pc engine game) to fightcade vid? We are not many playing it on fightcade yet but it is a deep and competitive simulation tennis game that would benefit from replays. It was very popular in France and few other EU countries at the time.

Game name : Final Match Tennis
Rom name : pce_finalmt
